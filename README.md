## How it Works
The architecture of this project was made entirely based on Clean Architecture, Clean Code Principles S.O.L.I.D, thus generating a reusable, organized and expandable system. As an example of data storage (Data) VoxiIO (this Project) uses a CMS called GraphCMS, through GraphQL, and Firebase as a secondary database, as a resource that firebase has, as given the realtime, which helps in the operation of Chat and Web Call/Video-Call.

## How it Works - Video Call
I didn't start the video call yet, it's just about to be updated, but im gonna use WebRTC and Socket.IO to connect the contacts.
